## Proxyrack Mobile Proxy Client

**Proxyrack Mobile Proxy Client** is a free and powerful solution for creating and managing mobile proxies directly from your mobile devices. Similar to **Proxidize** and **iProxy**, this app allows you to turn your device into a mobile proxy with minimal setup, offering both HTTP and SOCKS protocols for secure, reliable connections. With a user-friendly web dashboard, you can monitor and manage all connected devices with ease.

## Key Features

- **HTTP and SOCKS Protocols**: Choose your preferred protocol to match your application requirements.
- **Completely Free**: Enjoy unlimited access to all features at no cost.
- **Easy Setup**: Get up and running in under 2 minutes, with minimal configuration needed.
- **Web Dashboard**: View and manage all connected devices from a single, intuitive interface.
- **Location Flexibility**: Connect from various locations worldwide, ideal for bypassing geo-restrictions and enhancing privacy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/proxyrack/mobile-proxy-android.git
    ```
2. Download the precompiled APK from the [releases page](https://github.com/proxyrack/mobile-proxy-android/releases)
or build it yourself using the instructions below.
## How to build
1. Run the script 'build.sh'
2. The generated apk will be in the path ./app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

The build takes 10 or 15 min on an m1 mac. It builds much faster when not dockerized (30 seconds). That's something to look into.
