## How to build
1. Run the script 'build_docker_image.sh'
2. Run the script 'build_debug.sh'. The apk will be output to the path ./app/build/outputs/debug/app-debug.apk

The build takes 10 or 15 min on an m1 mac. It builds much faster when not dockerized (30 seconds). That's something to look into.
